Question 1
Print the first ArmStrong number in the range of 1042000 to 702648265 and exit the loop as soon
as you encounter the first armstrong number.
Use while loop

lower = 1042000 
upper = 702648265

for num in range(lower, upper + 1):

   # order of number
   order = len(str(num))
    
   # initialize sum
   sum = 0

   temp = num
   while temp > 0:
       digit = temp % 10
       sum += digit ** order
       temp //= 10

   if num == sum:
       print(num)
